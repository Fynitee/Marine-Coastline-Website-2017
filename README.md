# Marine-Coastline-Website-2017

This website was made for a class project with the idea of promoting a company. In this case, I chose an imaginary company, Fynite 
Corporations, who manages the tourist attraction of an aquarium called The Marine Coastline. All images were are either free from 
the internet or created by me, including the logo.  

Please note that the bottom of the ABOUT page may be misaligned as I had removed my own photo and that the instagram link is inaccurate. :))
